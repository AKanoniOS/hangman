Play hangman! Save your game with the spacebar and resume it later. 

While making this project, I learned about serialization and recreating objects from the stored data.
I learned about YAMl and other serialization formats. 
I learned about how to install and use tools like 'colorize' and 'tty-prompt'.
I learned and practiced more OOP concepts and was much more aware of encapsulation and abstraction this time around.
